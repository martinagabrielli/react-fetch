# Fetch data - Cat Facts App

This React application is a delightful and simple web app that fetches and displays random cat facts. It's designed to demonstrate the use of modern React features like hooks (useState, useEffect) and efficient state management for asynchronous API calls.

### Features

Random Cat Facts: Users can learn interesting and fun facts about cats with a simple click of a button.

Async Data Fetching: The app showcases how to perform API requests in React and handle the loading state gracefully.

Modern React Practices: Utilizes functional components and hooks, aligning with the latest trends and best practices in React development.

### How It Works

Upon loading, the app immediately fetches a random cat fact from the catfact.ninja API and displays it. A button allows users to fetch new facts, introducing them to new and interesting tidbits about cats with each click. While fetching new facts, the app displays a loading indicator, enhancing user experience by providing immediate feedback on their actions.
